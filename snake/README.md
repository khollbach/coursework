This is a 2-player [snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) game, written in Verilog for the Altera DE2 board. Most of the code is in `snake.v`.

It was surprisingly fun to play -- though I have to admit, the gameplay was basically ripped straight from [BMTron](http://www.games1729.com/serpentron/).
